1.	TGS files
  a.	One file for each tide gauge station
  b.	Space delimited text files (can be opened in excel)
  c.	Waveform data at each time step (water height, x velocity and y velocity) (units???)
2.	SD01.00001200.grd etc
  a.	These are GMT gridfiles that have water heights and velocities at snapshots in time (as opposed to the maximum height or max velocity)
  b.	They are made for each domain and unit of time passed (you can change specifics of this in the tsun.par file)
3.	SD01.initl_disp.grd etc etc
  a.	These are GMT grid files that show the initial water level for each domain was the earthquake has occurred
  b.	Good for checking your source etc
4.	SD01.zmax.grd etc
  a.	These are GMT gridfiles
  b.	One is created for each domain
  c.	Has the maximum water height for the simulations (presumably in metres)
5.	SD01.vmax.grd etc
  a.	These are GMT gridfiles
  b.	One is created for each domain
  c.	Has the maximum velocity reached for the simulations (presumably in m/s)
